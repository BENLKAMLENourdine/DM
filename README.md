# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Thought process

1. Navigate through the Figma design to extract the common data for building the design system (colors, fonts, sizes...)
2. Start implementing the UI/UX in nuxt3 following the Atomic design (Divide components into Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages)
3. Use Static data for a minimalist working app
4. Start building the HTTP server
5. Implement the communication between the server and the app using pinia for state management
   
## Setup
Create a .env file at the root of the project and place the content of .env.example in it

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
